## HyperUL

The repository contains  the related code for the paper, "*Hyperbolic Uncertainty Aware Semantic Segmentation*".

The SegFormer-B0 is used as the semantic image segmentation model. Besides, I do not intend to provide the whole code, because previous models cannot achieve optimal performance due to the lack of various data augmentation techniques.  

However, I plan to submit the newly developed semantic image segmentation code to the other repository. Also, I will paste the link here. 

 

If you have any questions, please drop me an email, "*bike.chen@oulu.fi*". Please note that you email might be filtered as the trash email, and then I may not reply to you immediately.
